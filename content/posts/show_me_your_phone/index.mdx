Recently, at work, I have been working with some Natural Language Processing techniques. Which, got me thinking. Is there any way I can use any of these techniques on my conversations.

(Un?)Fortunately, I found that iPhone backups also backup the phone’s chat logs. Following examples from Yorgos Askalidis’s [blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/heres-how-you-can-access-your-entire-imessage-history-on-your-mac-f8878276c6e9) and inspiration from David Richard Holtz’s [blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-your-imessage-data-says-about-you-daa186db16d), I did some basic analysis on my text messages.

After linking the frames I wanted to work with from the local sqlite3 database, I found I had 78,977 messages saved, the earliest being from October 29, 2016. Plotting the timestamps for all messages gives the following plot:
<div className="Image__Small">
  <img
    src="./images/all_texts.png"
    title=""
    alt=""
  />
</div>
Comparing the total messages per month would not make much sense given that 2019 is not completed and 2016 is not fully contained, so there is a gap from August to October across the years.
<div className="Image__Small">
  <img
    src="./images/years.png"
    title=""
    alt=""
  />
</div>
Plotting the years instead, I found that 2018 was a very bad year for my DMs. 2016 is the lowest, but only 2 full months were included in that year (and even then it was about half of 2018, yikes).

Next up, I decided to look at when I was responding or sending text messages. This is displayed on a 24-hour time format in local time, meaning it was a mixture of Pacific, Eastern and Central Daylight Time.
<div className="Image__Small">
  <img
    src="./images/time_of_day.png"
    title=""
    alt=""
  />
</div>
If you ever want me to respond immediately, 6 pm to 1 am is probably the ideal time. I was enjoying the visualizations and insights I found, but I was getting bored with the colors. I decided to find the times my conversations are the most active.
<div className="Image__Small">
  <img
    src="./images/time_heatmap.png"
    title=""
    alt=""
  />
</div>
I found that I am not exactly having the most thrilling conversations between the hours of 3 am and 1 pm on any given day. Weirdly enough, Tuesdays at 8 pm are the most active days for my conversation. Coincidentally, I have meetings most Tuesdays at 8 pm.

Next up, I decided to plot the conversations between some friends and I, including my mother.
<div className="Image__Small">
  <img
    src="./images/people_comparison.png"
    title=""
    alt=""
  />
</div>
Although the results aren’t an accurate portrayal of who I talk to because of the use of other forms of communication, it’s very interesting to see the big picture of my texting activity. Friend B and I’s conversations at the same time we decided to use Messenger, what a coincidence. My conversations with Friend C and D are very sporadic.

If this shows anything, is that no one is more consistent than my mom.

> Shout out to you mom.

Now, we all know that if you want to get to know someone you have to look at their frequently used emojis.
<div className="Image__Small">
  <img
    src="./images/emojis_sent_and_received.png"
    title=""
    alt=""
  />
</div>
To add some granularity, I decided to find the most common emojis in my conversations with my mom and my alphabetical friends.
<div className="Image__Small">
  <img
    src="./images/all_emojis_convos.png"
    title=""
    alt=""
  />
</div>
If we can learn anything from these emojis, it’s that I’m a pretty funny guy. Additionally, people appear to cry around me a lot. Probably because of how funny I am (contact my agent for bookings).

If you want to reproduce anything I did or check out some visualizations I did not include here, check out my Jupyter Notebook: [Github Repo](https://github.com/SoyCarloss/iMessage-Analysis).

Next up, I’ll be applying sentiment analysis on my conversations to finally understand what I said wrong and why I was left on read. Maybe even create a chatbot on my messages to automatically reply for me.

The data is the limit.
